# Heart-Disease-Prediction
To predict the Heart disease Prediction using the information about their sex, age, etc. As this is a classification task, we will be using KNN and Decision trees.
There will be three main steps in this experiment:
Feature Engineering 
Imputation
Training and Prediction

# Dataset

Heart disease dataset and will analyze, predict the result whether the patient has heart disease or normal, i.e. Heart disease prediction using Machine Learning. This prediction will make it faster and more efficient in healthcare sectors which will be a time-consuming process.
